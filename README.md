# guessing_game
Simple guessing game written in MIPS assembly for MARS IDE

(c) Otar Kalandadze

 Rules are explained ingame. pretty simple and dumb. Don't be malicious and 
 provide corresponding data types. Don't have time for exception handling rn.

 Maybe I'll add full game loop for repeatable game and error-handling too, idk.
